Capstone Project Carlos Figueroa
December 14th, 2022. Intro to Machine Learning Fall 2022.
New York University.

There are two models here. One that was used to build the report and its in order of ideas, explaining the rationale of each part (capstone_last_model.ipynb) and then the model that produced the highest accuracy that I submitted to the competition (best_score_model.ipynb). The last modification was done at 11:34 PM, on December 14th, 2022.

Here, we are going to use a rgb-d dataset to predict the distance between each finger from the box the robot is holding.

This code was run in Kaggle terminal, and that is why it points out to kaggle folders for the original data stored in the competition.
